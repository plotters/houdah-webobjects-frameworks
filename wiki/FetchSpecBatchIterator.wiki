#summary Memory stable operations on large data sets

Iterator to lazily instantiate batches of objects matching a given fetch specification. Allows for memory stable operations on very large data sets.

FetchSpecBatchIterator is part of the [HoudahEOControl] framework.

This code is dependant on the [QualifierAdditions InSetQualifier]. Ultimately this implies a runtime dependancy on the [HoudahEOAccess] framework. For obvious reasons there is no compile-time dependancy of the EOControl layer on the EOAccess layer.
