 * interface, but rather create an inner class that implements the interface
 * or better yet extends the default implementation. Indeed if an object
 * (e.g. an EO) which participates in an inheritance hierarchy is used as
 * receiver for notifications, registering or unregistering might break
 * functionality in a parent class.

	 * values. It's a good idea not to recreate the cached values
	 * immediately, but on an as-needed basis. You should refrain from
	 * changing persisted EO attributes from within this method as this
