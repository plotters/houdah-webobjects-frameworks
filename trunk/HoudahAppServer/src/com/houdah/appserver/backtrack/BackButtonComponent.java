/**
 * Subclass of Component that adds server side backtracking features. <br/>
 * 
 * The idea is that the constructor of a top-level component is called when the
 * page is instantiate from the previous request-response loop by a call to
 * pageWithName. Thus in the constructor it is possible to access the calling
 * context and determine it's top-level page. <br/>
 * 
 * A weak reference to that calling page is stored and can be retrieved by the
 * previousPage() action method.
 * 
 * For this to work the top-level component has to extend BackButtonPage as it
 * is the only one to be able get hold of the calling page. <br/>
 * 
 * Sub-components that want to provide a 'Back' button need only extend
 * BackButtonComponent so that they can call the previousPage() action method.
 * <br/>
