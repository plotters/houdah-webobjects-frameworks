/**
 * Subclass of BackButtonComponent to work around problems caused by client-side
 * backtracking. <br/>
 * 
 * The problems I currently run into are:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Wrong items being selected from WORepetitions after the user backtracked
 * <li>A component being asked to perform an action that is inappropriate in
 * the current state, e.g. cancel an edit after committing it
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The first problem is in fact caused by a more general problem: a component
 * always exits with only one state, i.e. the latest one. The user may however
 * backtrack to a cached page that matches a previous state: showing components
 * that should be hidden, displaying an earlier batch of a display group,... .<br/>
 * 
 * The first problem is closely related, but differs by the fact that the former
 * state of the component is permanently lost in that the moving to the new
 * state has non reversible effects like deleting from a database. <br/>
 * 
 * Another problem is that some actions modifying a display group may get
 * repeated, causing unwanted behaviour like deleting the wrong item. This
 * situation fits the 2nd problem: the state change is so dramatic that
 * backtracking is not tolerable. <br/>
 * 
 * The workaround I suggest tries to address these two problems. I tried to come
 * up with a mecanism that is very general and should apply to many situations.
 * Most notably, the business decision of what to do when the user has
 * backtracked is left to the afffected component. There will however be
 * situations that can not be addressed by my approach. This fix does not
 * address problems with users reloading a page. <br/>
 * 
 * The role of the BackTrackComponent is to detect client-side backtracking. It
 * offers hooks for its subclasses to handle the back tracking. A
 * DefaultImplementation offers state persistence allowing subclasses to recover
 * from simple backtracking situations.
