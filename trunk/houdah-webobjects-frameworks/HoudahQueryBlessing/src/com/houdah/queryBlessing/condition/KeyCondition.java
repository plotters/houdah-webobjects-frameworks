 * Condition applying to an EOQualifier.<br/>

 * qualifier can be verified against. E.g. one can require a qualifier to
 * provide a value for a given attribute.<br/>
 * 
 * The caller typically creates an instance of one of the subclasses that match
 * the desired condition and than call that instance's bless(qualifier) method
 * on qualifiers that need to match.
