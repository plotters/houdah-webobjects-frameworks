/**
 * DummyFormatter is a very, very simple formatter that does no more than
 * calling the toString() method on the object to format. <br/>
 * 
 * The reverse conversion parseObject does nothing: it simply returns the String
 * it recieved as argument. <br/>
 * 
 * This formatter serves as stand-in in situations where having a formatter is
 * required, but no typical formatting behavior is needed.
