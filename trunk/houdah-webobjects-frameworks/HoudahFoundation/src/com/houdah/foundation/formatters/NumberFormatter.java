/**
 * NumberFormatter is a very simple formatter that converts numbers into Strings
 * by using the number to format as index to an array of String objects.<br/>
 * 
 * E.g. with a values array of {"zero", "one", "two"}, the numbers 0, 1 and 2
 * will be represented by their english names. All other values lead to a null
 * String.<br/>
 * 
 * Additionally a default value may be provided for cases where the number to
 * format has no direct representation. If such a value is provided, only null
 * objects will have a null String representation. All other numbers will map
 * either to a value from the values array or the default value.<br/>
 * 
 * The most typical use of this formatter is the display of boolean values which
 * are represented as numbers. If 0 means "no" and any other value means "yes",
 * you would create a formater like this one: new NumberFormatter(new String[]
 * {"no", "yes"});<br/>
